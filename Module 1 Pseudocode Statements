//Exercise 1 
// This pseudocode is intended to compute the number of miles per gallon you get with your automobile

GET miles_driven
GET gallons_used

mpg = miles_driven / gallons_used

DISPLAY mpg


//Exercise 2 
// This pseudocode is intended to describe computing the daily cost of your rent in a 30-day month

GET monthly_rent

daily_rent - monthly_rent / 30

DISPLAY "Daily rent cost:", daily_rent

//Exercise 3
// This program accepts a user's monthly pay and rent, utilities, and grocery bills
// and displays the amount available for discretionary spending (which might be negative)
// Your program should output the pay and the total bills as well as the remaining discretionary amount

GET monthly_pay
GET rent_bill
GET utilities_bill
GET grocery_bill

total_bills = rent_bill + utilities_bill + grocery_bill
discretionary_spending = monthly_pay - total_bills

DISPLAY "Monthly Pay:", monthly_pay
DISPLAY "Total Bills:", total_bills
DISPLAY "Discretionary Spending:", discretionary_spending
